The goal of roundwork is to allow for flexible rounding beyond `base::round()`. Its main API is `reround()`, from which all implemented rounding procedures can be used.

All roundwork functions used to be part of [scrutiny](https://lhdjung.github.io/scrutiny/). They were outsourced here for better modularity within the errorverse.

## Installation

You can install the development version of roundwork like so:
